Biography

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Boston University. I'm a member of the Systems Research Group working with Prof. Orran Krieger as my advisor. My research interests lie broadly in the fields of Virtualization and Cloud Computing. I am interested in resource allocation in data-centers, performance optimization for Big Data processing platforms in cloud and monitoring of computing resources in cloud. Before joining Boston University, I received my MSc from State University of New York at Binghamton, Department of Computer Science advised by Prof. Ping Yang and my BSc from Bogazici University, Department of Information Systems Engineering.
