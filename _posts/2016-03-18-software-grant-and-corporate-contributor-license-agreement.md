<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">(y r201503)</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Based on the Apache Software Company Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.txt">http://www.apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.txt</a> (v r190612)</p>

Thank you for your interest in Massachusetts Open Cloud Project (the "Project"). In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, the Project must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the Project and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

This version of the Agreement allows an entity (the "Corporation") to submit Contributions to the Project, to authorize Contributions submitted by its designated employees to the Project, and to grant copyright and patent licenses thereto.

If you have not already done so, please complete and sign, then scan and email a pdf file of this Agreement to <a href="mailto:grady@bu.edu"><em>grady@bu.edu</em>.</a> Alternatively, you may send it by facsimile to the Project at <em>(617)353-6457</em>. If necessary, send an original signed Agreement to <em>Ellen Grady; Hariri Institute for Computing; 111 Cummington Mall; Boston, MA 02215</em>

<em> </em>

Please read this document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records. Corporation name:                        <u>                                 </u>

For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."
