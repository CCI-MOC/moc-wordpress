<h4 class="tmm_desc">Biography</h4>

<div class="tmm_desc">Dr. Evan Weinberg received his PhD degree from the Physics Department at Boston University in September, 2015, under advisors Prof. Claudio Rebbi and Prof. Richard Brower. He currently has a joint postdoctoral researcher position between the MOC and under Prof. Brower as a <a href="http://www.scidac.gov/">DoE SciDAC</a> software researcher. His physics research focuses on Lattice Gauge Theory (LGT) for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics, which is the intersection of quantum field theory, algorithms, high performance computing (HPC), and particle phenomenology. His research with the MOC focuses on bringing existing HPC applications onto the MOC and deploying elastic computational services.</div>
