<p>There are technical areas where a community will want to interact/share information. They have no deliverables but will help drive directions and priorities on the various projects and efforts, and will provide the larger group with insight on the directions of both Industry and research.</p>

<p>The current MOC Working Groups are :</p>

<ul>
<li>Networking </li>
<li>Storage</li>
<li>Cloud Security</li>
<li>Data sets</li>
<li>Big Data</li>
<li>HPC</li>
<li>Compute and accelerators</li>
</ul>
