<h1>Process for Obtaining User Support</h1>
1) Obtain specific error messages - either copy and paste from a terminal or a take a screenshot.

2) If have an OS Ticket login, do a quick search of reports to see if your issue has been previously addressed

3) Review the "Trouble Shooting Tips" on OS Ticket

4) If you are a student, ask  TA or professor before contacting MOC support

5) If you are still unable to resolve your issue, please submit a ticket on <a href="https://osticket.massopen.cloud/index.php">OS Ticket </a>. Please make sure to identify the specific project, VM, volume, etc. A report that says “I can’t mount my volume on my VM” isn’t specific enough.
