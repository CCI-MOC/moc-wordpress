<h2 style="text-align: center"><strong>Thank you for attending the Third Annual Massachusetts Open Cloud Workshop!</strong></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400">The Third Annual Massachusetts Open Cloud (MOC) Workshop was held on </span>October 3-4, 2017 at Boston University. The MOC workshop welcomed users of the MOC, researchers and startups interested in cloud computing, students and our industry partners. The MOC has become a growing and active community of users and a broad set of industry/academic research projects.

<span style="font-weight: 400">The workshop was designed to engage all parties with any interest in the MOC - it does not matter if you have been a part of the MOC's development from the start, or are just hearing about it and want to learn more. The segments are described below: </span>

<strong>October 3</strong>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The day kicked off with a overviews on the MOC vision and orients users with the latest on the MOC technologies and offerings. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Over the course of the day, 10-minute Ted-style talks were given in three Micro-talk Sessions. These talks are designed to give the audience a high-level overview of a given topic. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Throughout the conference space posters designed by talk presenters were displayed. Anyone interested in exploring the content covered in a talk on a deeper, more technical level was encouraged to find the accompanying poster to engage with the speaker. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Two Topic Roundtable Sessions provided additional opportunities for all attendees to explore MOC-related topics on a deeper level. These sessions, which were facilitated by MOC staff and collaborators, provided an opportunity for open dialogue. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The success of the MOC hinges upon its strong partnerships. During the Industry Partner Panel, attendees  heard from the MOC's industry partners who discussed their relationship with the MOC and the value their companies are deriving from this unique partnership.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The event closed with a reception, allowing additional time to discuss talks and posters, as well as opportunities for networking.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">An invitation only dinner was held following the reception.</span></li>
</ul>
<strong>October 4 (Morning)</strong>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The MOC Leadership, Academic Advisory Board and Core Partners met to discuss strategic and business related initiatives. (Invitation only)</span></li>

<strong><u>Session Descriptions and Materials</u></strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>OpenStack</strong>: The MOC offers an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering based on OpenStack, providing users with self-service access to virtual machines, object storage, and on-demand Big Data environments (Hadoop, Spark, Pig etc.). This tutorial will show you how to get started using this environment. OpenStack Tutorial and Demo Video</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Cloud Dataverse &amp; Big Data</strong>: Cloud Dataverse is a collaboration between the MOC and the Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS) to enable a repository for storing and sharing datasets hosted in a cloud. This tutorial will show users how to access and share datasets using Cloud Dataverse as well as how to spin up different computational tools on those datasets using the MOC. <a href="https://massopen.cloud/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Cloud-Dataverse.pdf">Cloud Dataverse Tutorial</a>, Cloud Dataverse Demo</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>MOC OpenShift</strong>: On top of our OpenStack service, the MOC and Red Hat have just started offering an OpenShift service. OpenShift offers users a self-scaling container platform with support for anything that can be containerized including web frameworks, databases, and messaging queues. In seconds, one can spin up new containers along with rich Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment capabilities built in. This tutorial will introduce you to the essentials of OpenShift and the underlying Kubernetes/Docker technologies upon which it is built. OpenShift Tutorial, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEN1vTXud7rXyG_n2g7RhrO1oNbjDkfeV">OpenShift Tutorial Video</a></li>
