Please save the date - The Fourth Annual Massachusetts Open Cloud (MOC) Workshop will be held on October 30-31, 2018 at Boston University. The MOC workshop welcoms users of the MOC, researchers and startups interested in cloud computing, students and our industry partners. The MOC has become a growing and active community of users and a broad set of industry/academic research projects.

The workshop is designed to engage all parties with any interest in the MOC – it does not matter if you have been a part of the MOC’s development from the start, or are just hearing about it and want to learn more.
